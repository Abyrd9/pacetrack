This is a Typescript, TanstackStart, Tailwind project.
The primitve components to use are in /packages/web-app/src/components/primitives
All other components go into the /components folder in the place that makes the most sense

When writing types do NOT use the "any" type. Use "unknown" if it is actually unknown. But always try ot infer or define the type.
